DotNet Architect AI is not just a code generator — it is a **domain-specialized system** that transforms user requirements into a **complete, architecturally correct .NET backend**.  
It ensures consistent patterns, clean layering, proper DI setup, caching, policies, configuration handling, and adherence to best practices — all areas where generic LLM prompts often fail.

### Why This Tool Is Necessary
Generic LLMs can generate code, but their responses:
- vary every time  
- may be inconsistent  
- often violate architectural standards  

DotNet Architect AI solves these problems by enforcing:

- **Standardized project structure**  
- **Reusable architectural patterns**  
- **Correct dependency injection wiring**  
- **Coherent naming conventions**  
- **Repository / Service / Controller layering**  
- **Authentication & role-based access included by design**  
- **APIs that compile and run without manual fixing**

This transforms code generation from “helpful text” into a **repeatable, reliable engineering workflow**.
